            <h2>Online <span>learning</span></h2>
            <p>There are, of course, some significant differences between distance learning and traditional learning;
              the most obvious being the absence of a requirement for physical attendance in a specific location. </p>
            <p>When participating in distance learning, students experience significantly more freedom in their approach
              to learning. This can be a positive aspect in that students can choose courses based on their own
              schedules, the teaching style offered, and the modalities used.</p>
